## Project Overview

The **Multilingual FAQ API** is designed to manage FAQs in different languages. It allows users to query FAQs in their preferred language, offering flexibility for international applications. The API also includes authentication, caching, and error handling mechanisms, as well as integration with third-party services like Google Translate to handle translations.

### Key Features:
- **CRUD operations** for managing FAQs.
- **Multilingual support** for both questions and answers.
- **Authentication** using JWT tokens.
- **Caching** with Redis to speed up API responses.
- **Error handling** middleware for consistent error responses.
- **Logging** using Winston for detailed logging of application activities.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Translation**: Google Translate API
- **Caching**: Redis
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Validation**: Joi
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest
- **Development Tools**: Nodemon (for automatic server restarts during development)

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud instance, like MongoDB Atlas)
- **Redis** (if you're using caching)

### Steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multilingual-faq-api.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder**:
    ```bash
    cd multilingual-faq-api
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following configurations:
    ```bash
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/multilingual_faq
    PORT=3000
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
    REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379   # Optional, for caching
    ```

---

## Configuration

### `.env` File:
This file is used to store sensitive environment variables for the application, such as the MongoDB URI, Redis URL, and your Google API key for translations. Ensure this file is in the root directory of the project.

Example `.env` configuration:
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/multilingual_faq
PORT=3000
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key-here
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual values.

---

## Usage

Once everything is set up, you can start the server with the following commands:

### Running the server in development mode:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This command will use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server whenever changes are made to the code.

### Running the server in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```
This command will start the server without `nodemon`, which is more suitable for production.

---

## API Endpoints

The following are the available endpoints for the multilingual FAQ API:

### User Routes (Authentication)
- **POST** `/api/v1/user/register`: Register a new user.
- **POST** `/api/v1/user/login`: Login and get a JWT token for authentication.

### FAQ Routes
- **GET** `/api/v1/faq`: Get a list of FAQs.
- **GET** `/api/v1/faq/:id`: Get a single FAQ by ID.
- **POST** `/api/v1/faq`: Create a new FAQ (requires authentication).
- **PUT** `/api/v1/faq/:id`: Update an existing FAQ (requires authentication).
- **DELETE** `/api/v1/faq/:id`: Delete an FAQ by ID (requires authentication).

### Translation Routes (Optional)
- **POST** `/api/v1/translate`: Translate FAQ question/answer to another language (requires Google Translate API key).

---

## Testing

This project includes unit and integration tests to ensure the functionality works as expected.

### Run the tests:
```bash
npm test
```

### Test Setup:
The project uses **Jest** for testing, with **Supertest** for testing API routes. Ensure the MongoDB server is running before executing the tests, or use a mock database for testing purposes.

---

## Running in Development Mode

To run the project in development mode, use the `npm run dev` command. This will start the server with `nodemon`, which automatically restarts the server whenever you make changes to the code. This is useful during the development phase as it eliminates the need to manually restart the server.

1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

2. Open your browser or API client (e.g., Postman) and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/faq` to test the FAQ API.

3. You can also check the logs in the terminal as `nodemon` will automatically restart the server whenever changes are made.

---

## Deployment

### Deploying to Heroku (or similar platforms):

1. Create a **Heroku** account and install the **Heroku CLI**.
2. Log in to your Heroku account via the terminal:
    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

3. Initialize a Git repository (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

4. Create a new Heroku app:
    ```bash
    heroku create multilingual-faq-api
    ```

5. Set up your environment variables on Heroku:
    ```bash
    heroku config:set MONGO_URI="your-mongodb-uri"
    heroku config:set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-api-key"
    heroku config:set PORT=3000
    ```

6. Push the code to Heroku:
    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

7. After deployment, your app will be available on a URL like `https://multilingual-faq-api.herokuapp.com`.
